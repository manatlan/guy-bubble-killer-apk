# guy-bubble-killer-apk
Just the sources of my [guy](https://guy-docs.glitch.me/)'s demo apk : Bubble Killer's game ;-)

Here is the [apk on the playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manatlan.guy.bubblekiller) (when it will be accepted !!)

It's just a little game, with graphics & sound (you only need to kill all 100 bubbles as fast as you can).

It's a demo, of what you can do with [guy](https://guy-docs.glitch.me/) python lib ;-)

**Note:**
The server side is just handling the best score in its guy's config. All is done client side, with html/webcomponent/js/css.

If you want to test yourself ... Just follow the [HowTo](https://guy-docs.glitch.me/howto_build_apk_android/), to try to reproduce the apk.
